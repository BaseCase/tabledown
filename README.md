# TableDown

It takes a Markdown table from stdin plaintext and pads it out to look nice.


## TODO
- [ ] pick a better word than 'format' for the public API
- [ ] refactor a bit
- [ ] make this a legit gem
- [ ] strip superfluous whitespace from cells
- [ ] flesh out README
- [ ] write instructions on how to hook this up to Automator.app (maybe also a blog post?)
- [ ] handle more use cases at command line
